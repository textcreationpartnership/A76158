1. CONFIRMATION AND RESTAURATION The necessary means of REFORMATION And RECONCILIATION.

    _ Prop. I. It is here supposed, that the Infants of Believers should by Baptism be admitted into the Church, and so be partakers of Infant Priveledges.

    _ Prop. 2. There are many Priveledges belonging to the Adult Members of the Church, which Infant members are not capable of.

    _ Prop. 3. The Continuation of Priveledges received in Infancy, is part of the Priveledges of the Adult; or the Restoration of them if they be lost.

    _ Prop. 4. The Title-Condition of Infant Church-membership and Priviledges, is not the same with the Title-Condition of the Church-membership and Priviledges of the Adult; so that if this new Condition be not performed when See the Rubrick of the Common Prayer Book before Confirmation after cited. men come to Age, their former Title ceaseth, and there is no other that ariseth in his stead.

    _ Prop. 5. As a Personal Faith is the Condition before God of Title to the Priviledges of the Adult; so the Profession of this Faith, is the Condition of his Right before the Church; and without this Profession, he is not to be tak•n as an Adult membtr, nor admitted to the Priviledges of such.

    _ Prop. 6. It is not every kind of Profession, that is the Condition, or necessary qualification of those that are to be admitted to the Priviledges of Adult members, but such a Profession as God hath made necessary, by his express Word, and by the Nature of the Object, and the Ʋses, and Ends, to which be doth require it.

    _ Prop. 7. The Profession of those that expect the Church-sttate and Priviledges of the Adult is to be tried, judged, and Approved by the Pastours of the Church, to whose Office it is that this belongeth.

    _ Prop. 8. Though it belong to the Pastours Office to judge of the Profession of such expectants, yet are they bound up by the Laws of Christ, what Profession to accept, and what to refuse: and if by breaking these Laws they shall dangerously, or grosly wrong the Church: it belongeth to the Magistrate to correct them, and to the people to admonish them, and disown their sinne.

    _ Prop. 9. It is most evident that Ministers, People, and Magistrates, have each a Power of Judging; but different, as they have different works.

    _ Prop. 10. To this Ministerial Approbation of the Profession, and Qualification of the expectant, there is to be adjoyned a Ministerial Investiture, or Delivery of the Benefit expected.

    _ Prop. 11. The solemn Ministerial Investiture of Professours, into the Right of the Church-priviledges of the Adult, is either 1. Of the unbaptized, who are now first entered. 2. Or of the Baptized in Infancy, that never proved ungodly, nor violated that first Covenant. 3. Or of those Baptized, whether in Infancy or at Age, that have since Proved wicked, and broke that Covenant. The first of these Investitures is, to be by Baptism; the second by Confirmation; and the third by Absolution. So that the solemn Investiture that I am pleading for, is by Confirmation to one sort (that never proved ungodly since their Baptism) and by Absolution to the other sort that broke their Covenant.

    _ Prop. 12. This solemn Investiture on personal Profession, being thus proved the Ordinance of God, for the solemn renewing of the Covenant of Grace, between God and the Adult Covenanter, it must needs follow, that it is a corroborating Ordinance, and that corroborating Grace is to be expected in it from God, by all that come to it in sincerity of heart: And so it hath the name of Confirmation upon that account also.

    _ Prop. 13. Ministerial Imposition of hands in Confirmation, and the fore-described sort of Absolution, is a lawfull, and convenient Ceremony, and ordinarily to be used, as it hath been of old by the Ʋniversall Church. But yet it is not of such Necessity, but that we must dispense in this Ceremony with scrupulous Consciences, that cannot be satisfied to submit to it.

    _ Prop. 14. Though in Receiving Adult persons out of Infidelity by Baptism into the Church; a sudden Profession without any stay to see their Reformation, may serve turn; yet in the receiving those that were Baptized heretofore, into the Number of Adult-members, or to the Priviledges of such, their lives must be enquired after, which must be such as do not confute their Profession.

    _ Prop. 15. It is not of flat Necessity that the Profession of the Expectant be made in the open Congregation, or before many, in order to his Confirmation and Admittance.

    _ Prop. 16. When a Person is admitted among the Adult-members of a Particular Church; as well as the Ʋniversal, his Profession and Admission must be either before the Church, or Satisfactorily made Known to the Church at least, who must Approve of it by a Judgment of Discretion, in order to their Communion with him: and this among us is the ordinary case; because it is the duty of all that have opportunity, to joyn themselves to some particular Church; and it is in such Churches, that Communion in publique Worship and Order must be had, either statedly, or transiently and temporarily.

    _ Prop 17. It is convenient, though not of Necessity, that every Church do keep a Register, of all that are admitted thus into the Number of the Adult-members.

    _ Prop. 18. Those that were never thus Ministerially and Explicitly Approved, Confirmed or Absolved (after an ungodly life,) but have been permitted without it, to joyne ordinarily with the Church in Prayer and Praises, and have been admitted to the Communion of the Church, in the Lords Supper, are approved and confirmed, Eminently though not Formally: though in so doing, both the Pastours and themselves did sin against God, by the violation of his holy Order. So that such may be a true Church, though much corrupted or disordered.

    _ Prop. 19. So exceeding great and many are the mischiefs that have befallen us, by the neglect of a solemn meet Transition from an Infant, into the Adult Church state, and which undoubtedly will continue, till this be remedyed, that all Magistrates, Ministers, and People, that dissemble not, in professing themselves to be Christians, should with speed and diligence attempt the Cure.

    _ Prop. 20. So many and great are the Benefits, that would follow the general practice of this duty, of Trying, Approving, and Confirming (or Absolving) all those that enter into the number of Adult Christians, that it should mightily provoke all Christian Magistrates, Ministers, and People, to joyne in a speedy and vigorous execution of it.
I Have two things yet more to do upon this Subject. 1. To answer some Objections, and 2. To give somI Come now to the last part of my taske, which is to give some brief Directions for the most effectuTHe Peoples duty in order to this Reformation before mentioned, is, 1.
